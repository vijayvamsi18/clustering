# 🔍 Clustering Analysis Project

This project demonstrates **unsupervised learning** techniques to discover hidden patterns in data using **clustering algorithms**. It includes preprocessing, model building, visualization, and evaluation of cluster performance.

---

## 📁 File Included

- `Clustering (2).ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing step-by-step implementation of clustering techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To group similar data points using clustering algorithms and analyze the structure of the dataset without using target labels.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Data loading & cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Scaling & normalization  
- Clustering techniques:
  - ✅ KMeans Clustering  
  - ✅ DBSCAN  
  - ✅ Hierarchical Clustering  
- Visualization using 2D plots, elbow method, and dendrograms  
- Evaluation using Silhouette Score, Inertia, etc.
